/// The EVM native is designed such that all EVM state is represented
/// as Move resources and thus all keys can be represented by an Aptos
/// `StateKey`. However, we must still special-case the EVM addresses
/// here because the "real" key of the trie (the one who's nibbles are
/// actually used to navigate from node to node) is the hash of the
/// "semantic" key given here. Therefore, Ethereum clients expect to be
/// able to verify the Merkle proof for an account using the "real" key
/// given by `keccack256(address)`, and this does not work if our key is
/// instead derived as `keccak256(state_key)`. Thus for compatibility with
/// Ethereum tooling that is checking the state of accounts in our EVM,
/// we must explicitly separate those keys in the trie instead of using
/// the uniform `StateKey` which reflects the actual way the state is stored.
